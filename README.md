# Jishaku Example
This repository is a [Jishaku](https://pypi.org/project/jishaku/) example Discord bot.
Make sure to change the token in the last line to avoid errors.

# Usage
To use the bot, open up command line, cd into the directory, and then type this:
`py main.py`

Then, wait a few seconds, and after a while there should be output in the command line saying that the bot is loaded.
If an error occurs, please let me know by contacting me at Discord:

# What do I do?
You need to select the file matching your OS. If you have a Linux / Ubuntu OS, run the `main_linux.py` file. However, if you have Windows, you need to run the `main_windows.py` file. You can delete the one that you won't use and rename it to `main.py` to shorten the name.

# Credits
Credits go to the original creators of Jishaku - [Gorialis](https://pypi.org/user/Gorialis/), and also contributors.
