# Jishaku Example
This repository is a [Jishaku](https://pypi.org/project/jishaku/) example Discord bot.
Make sure to insert your bot token in the last line to avoid errors.

# Usage
To use the bot, open up command line, cd into the directory, and then type this:
`python main.py`

Then, wait a few seconds, and after a while there should be output in the command line saying that the bot is loaded.
If an error occurs, please let me know by contacting me at Discord:
VoidableMethod#0001

# What do I do?
When you run "main.py" the file automatically detects the OS it's running on so you don't have to pick the right file as the script will do it for you.

# Credits
Credits go to the original creators of Jishaku - [Gorialis](https://pypi.org/user/Gorialis/), and also contributors.
